# Atomic

**The AgentOps Governance Platform for Software Delivery**

> Make AI coding agents provable, reversible, and affordable‚Äîon any IDE or platform.

---

## üöÄ Overview

Atomic is an enterprise-grade governance platform designed to make AI coding agents production-ready. By providing deterministic transforms, mission-critical checkpoints, and financial controls, Atomic ensures that AI-driven software delivery is safe, auditable, and cost-effective.

Whether you're using GitHub Copilot, Cursor, or any other AI coding assistant, Atomic adds the governance layer that enterprises need to adopt AI agents with confidence.

## üèóÔ∏è Core Pillars

### 1. **Deterministic Transform Engine (DTE)**

Transform agent plans into verifiable, type-safe code changes.

- **Typed Change Specifications**: Converts AI agent plans into AST patches with built-in invariants and proofs
- **Language Pack Support**: 
  - **Available Now**: TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, Java
  - **Coming Soon**: C#, Go
- **Formal Verification**: Auto-generated tests and proofs ensure correctness before deployment

### 2. **Mission Checkpoints**

Time-boxed, reversible development cycles that keep AI agents on track.

- **Structured Workflows**: Planning ‚Üí Execution ‚Üí Verification cycles
- **Reversible Batches**: Every change can be rolled back atomically
- **Auto-Snapshots**: Automatic state preservation at every checkpoint
- **Progress Tracking**: Clear visibility into agent progress and decision-making

### 3. **FinOps & Policy Router**

Control AI costs and enforce governance policies across your organization.

- **Budget Management**: Set per-repository and per-story spending limits
- **Model Routing**: Intelligent routing rules to optimize cost vs. performance
- **Cost Forecasting**: Predict expenses before agents execute
- **Approval Workflows**: Human-in-the-loop approvals when thresholds are exceeded

### 4. **Zero-Trust Boundary Gateway**

Enterprise-grade security for AI agent operations.

- **Secret & PII Scrubbing**: Automatic detection and redaction of sensitive data
- **Access Control**: Configurable allow/deny lists for resources and operations
- **Vendor Retention Policies**: Control how long external AI vendors retain your data
- **Deployment Flexibility**: On-premises, VPC, or cloud routing options

### 5. **Kits & Knowledge**

Accelerate adoption with reusable templates and best practices.

- **Prompt Kits**: Pre-built, battle-tested prompts for common workflows
- **Codebase Archetypes**: Templates for different project types and architectures
- **Golden Flows**: Optimized workflows with telemetry-driven continuous improvement
- **Knowledge Base**: Organizational memory that improves agent performance over time

## üí° Why Atomic?

| Challenge | Atomic Solution |
|-----------|----------------|
| **"AI agents make unpredictable changes"** | DTE provides deterministic, verified transforms |
| **"We can't afford to let AI run wild"** | FinOps controls with budgets and approvals |
| **"Security won't approve AI code access"** | Zero-Trust Gateway with PII scrubbing and access controls |
| **"Agent mistakes are expensive to fix"** | Mission Checkpoints enable instant rollback |
| **"Every team reinvents the wheel"** | Kits & Knowledge share best practices org-wide |
